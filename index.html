	<h3 class="ml-3">Python Virtual Assisstant</h3>
	<p class="lead p-3">
		This is a virtual assisstant with a simple Graphical User Interface.
		Written in Python 3.7 and is and always open source.It uses the wikipedia and wolfaramalpha
		module.It also has text-to-speech functionality i.e it gives voice output.
	</p>

	<h3 class="ml-3 mt-3">This Website!</h3>
	<p class="lead p-3">
		Yes this website is also a testament of my skills in which I made it from scratch using bootstrap-4, HTML5, and CSS.
		And like always the code used for this website is also free open-source. 
	</p>

	<h3 class="ml-3 mt-3">Gmail Automation Script</h3>
	<p class="lead p-3">
		This simple  script was truly an exciting one to create where it uses python's 3rd party module Selenium.
		It also uses Chrome driver.
		Note That this a console application you need to have selenium installed and chrome driver in order for this to work. 
	</p>

	<h3 class="ml-3 mt-3">VLC Musicplayer Automation Script</h3>
	<p class="lead p-3">
		This is in conjuction in with my Virtual Assisstant program where thorugh voice input you'll be able to 
		<b>open, close, skip, backplay, pause, play.</b>Moreover it even gives voice output!. Note that it was optimized for my laptop so you would need to tweak it a little and if you need any help don't be afraid to email me.

	<h3 class="ml-3 mt-3">Terminal Hacker game</h3>
	<p class="lead p-3">
		This was made using the course the complete C# developer unity 3D. This was my first game  made by the unity game engine.
		It uses basic C# and commands provided by the instructors.

	<h3 class="ml-3 mt-3">Media Player Automation</h3>
	<p class="lead p-3">
		Finally after alot of googling I made progress this is better version of my VLC media automation script
		where you needed to wait and can't do anything while the GUI automation takes control, so rather than
		controlling the GUI I simulate the keyboard so utlizing the pause/play, fast, and back button I control
		the default media player and the other players with <b>voice input</b>.
		Note that there are still little kinks but the core program works also run this while the media is open
		this is for the default media player and for the other media players there window must be the current window
		moreover use the python 3.6 interpreter as pyaudio does not support 3.6+ versions.

	<h3 class="ml-3 mt-3">Gback</h3>
	<p class="lead p-3">
		This was a thinker, this program extracts all the emails that have sent you an email in which 
		it extracts them and saves them in an excel file.For this to work you need to do some tweaks
		for your gmail accounts in which you need to turn on access for less secure apps(don't worry link 
		is with the Gback link).Furthermore it takes time like 14 - 24 min depending from since do you 
		want to save the emails.Moreover for right now do this once,further developement is needed, if you
		want to back up again......which you'll do obviously! Anyways here's the link to my code on my github,
		till then happy typing!!!

	<h3 class="ml-3 mt-3"> NoteApp  </h3>	
	<p class="lead p-3">
		This was a fun one, after learning some intermediate javascript, I started working on node.js made a basic chat app.
		After that though fell under rut, university finally getting to me. Nonetheless I went on got a course on Udmey to 
		refine my skills and understand Node a bit more, The instructor taught us to make this in the first section which was
		cool af because I never used JSON, so that was a first. Right now this a basic CLI app but have plans for a GUI Interface
		so stay tuned febbas. Well till then happy typing!

	<p class="lead p-3">
		After making the CLI version I quickly got around to making the frontend and it took more time than I expected as my design sense is me banging my head on a wall thinking of a nice responsive minimalist design. However after weeks of brainstorming and doing the good ol' google fu finally made something I'm proud of. Hope you guys like it and as always 
		happy typing!

Furthermore this was my first time learning on NoSQL databases which was really great although mongoose's documentation did try confuse me a bit. <strong>This was completely back end</strong> but will integrate this Noter as I keep on treking on this Node course. Till then guys happy typing!
